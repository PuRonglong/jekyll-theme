You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

<!-- more -->

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```js
function categoryDisplay(){
	// show all
	$('.home>ul[post-cate!=all]').hide();

	// show tag post list when click tag link
	$('.categary-p').click(function(){
		var cate = $(this).attr('cate');

		$('.home>ul[post-cate!=' + cate + ']').hide(250);
		$('.home>ul[post-cate=' + cate + ']').show(400);$('.home>ul[post-cate=' + cate + ']').show(400);$('.home>ul[post-cate=' + cate + ']').show(400);
	});
}
```
